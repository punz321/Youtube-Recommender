# Overview
(STILL IN PROGRESS)
- A website to show recommended videos based on your search query using Youtube api

- i made this project to learn more about how APIs work
- an error occurs while fetching details from YoutubeAPI


# Running the file
- download and open all three files in a code editor of your choice (VSC best imo üëç)
- download node js and axios and go to command prompt or terminal and type
  "node -v" to check if you have correctly downloaded it
- go to https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started and follow the steps to get a youtube api key
- open cmd and go to the directory where these files are located (make sure they are in the same one)
- type "node server.js" in cmd, it should show server running on port 3000
- then open the html file and search your query
